# 📈 AI-Powered Stock Price Predictor

This project is part of the Oracle Data Science Professional Certification under the Naan Mudhalvan scheme (2025). It aims to build a real-time, AI-driven system for predicting stock market prices using time series analysis.

## 🚀 Project Goal

To develop a robust stock forecasting system that uses:
- Deep learning (LSTM / GRU)
- Time-series statistical models (Prophet, ARIMA)
- Real-time data feed using yFinance API
- Web deployment with Streamlit for investor-ready UI

## 📊 Features

- ✅ Real-time stock price prediction (short-term + long-term)
- ✅ Trend direction classification (bullish / bearish)
- ✅ Interactive visual dashboards
- ✅ Model comparison: Prophet vs LSTM vs GRU
- ✅ Streamlit-powered web UI
- ✅ Powered by Kaggle + Live data from Yahoo Finance
